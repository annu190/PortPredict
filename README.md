# PortPredict
This project presents a machine learning-based system to optimize port operations. It focuses on improving container terminal efficiency, vessel scheduling, and supply chain management. The goal is to enhance port performance while reducing operational costs. The system uses historical port data and external factors like weather and congestion to predict vessel arrival times, optimize berth allocation, and improve cargo processing. By providing real-time insights,it helps port authorities make better decisions and handle increasing traffic efficiently
